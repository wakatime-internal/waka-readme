# Dev Metrics in Readme [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/athul/waka-readme.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/athul/waka-readme)

![Project Preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8397274/87243943-e6b45c00-c457-11ea-94c9-2aa0bf241be8.png)

[WakaTime](https://wakatime.com) Weekly Metrics on your Profile Readme:

**Forum**: [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/athul/waka-readme/discussions)

## Prep Work

1. You need to update the markdown file(.md) with 2 comments. You can refer [here](#update-your-readme) for updating it.
2. You'll need a WakaTime API Key. You can get that from your WakaTime Account Settings
   - You can refer [here](#new-to-wakatime), if you're new to WakaTime
3. **Optional** You'll need a GitHub API Token with `repo` scope from [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) if you're running the action not in your Profile Repository
   - You can use [this](#other-repository-not-profile) example to work it out
4. You need to save the WakaTime API Key (and the GitHub API Token, if you need it) in the repository secrets. You can find that in the Settings of your Repository.Be sure to save those as the following.
   - WakaTime-api-key as `WAKATIME_API_KEY = <your wakatime API Key>`and
   - The GitHub Access Token as `GH_TOKEN=<your github access token>`
5. You can follow either of the Two Examples according to your needs to get started with.

> I strongly suggest you to run the Action in your Profile Repo since you won't be needing a GitHub Access Token

This Action will run everyday at 00.00 UTC

## Update your Readme

Add a comment to your `README.md` like this:

```md
<!--START_SECTION:waka-->
<!--END_SECTION:waka-->
```

These lines will be our entry-points for the dev metrics.

## New to WakaTime

WakaTime gives you an idea of the time you really spent on coding. This helps you boost your productivity and competitive edge.

- Head over to <https://wakatime.com> and create an account.
- Get your WakaTime API Key from your [Account Settings in WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/settings/account).
- Install the [WakaTime plugin](https://wakatime.com/plugins) in your favourite editor / IDE.
- Paste in your API key to start the analysis.

Alternatively, you can also choose to fetch data from third-party WakaTime-compatible services like [Wakapi](https://wakapi.dev) or [Hakatime](https://github.com/mujx/hakatime) instead. For details, see [extras](#extras) section below.

### Profile Repository

_If you're executing the workflow on your Profile Repository (`<username>/<username>`)_

> You wouldn't need a GitHub Access Token since GitHub Actions already makes one for you.

Please follow the steps below:

1. Go to your `<username>/<username>/actions`, hit `New workflow`, `set up a workflow yourself`, delete all the default content github made for you.
2. Copy the following code and paste it to your new workflow you created at step 1:

    ```yml
    name: Waka Readme

    on:
      workflow_dispatch:
      schedule:
        # Runs at 12am UTC
        - cron: "0 0 * * *"

    jobs:
      update-readme:
        name: Update this repo's README
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: athul/waka-readme@master
            with:
              WAKATIME_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.WAKATIME_API_KEY }}
    ```

3. Go to your repo secrets by hitting `Settings => Secrets` tab in your profile repo. You can also enter the url <https://github.com/USERNAME/USERNAME/settings/secrets> . Please replace the `USERNAME` with your own username.
4. Create a new `Secret`. `Name`: `WAKATIME_API_KEY`, `Value`: Paste the Wakatime API key here.

  If you don't know what is the key, please go to [Wakatime API](https://wakatime.com/api-key) to find your API Key there.

   1. Add a comment to your `README.md` like this:

       ```md
       <!--START_SECTION:waka-->
       <!--END_SECTION:waka-->
       ```

   2. Go to Workflows menu (mentioned in step 1), click `Waka Readme`, click `Run workflow`.
   3. Go to your profile page. you will be able to see it.


### Other Repository (not Profile)

_If you're executing the workflow on another repo other than `<username>/<username>`_

You'll need to get a [GitHub Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token) with a `repo` scope and save it in the Repo Secrets `GH_TOKEN = <Your GitHub Access Token>`

Here is Sample Workflow File for running it:

```yml
name: Waka Readme

on:
  schedule:
    # Runs at 12am UTC
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"

jobs:
  update-readme:
    name: Update Readme with Metrics
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: athul/waka-readme@master
        with:
          WAKATIME_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.WAKATIME_API_KEY }}
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
          REPOSITORY: <username/username> # optional, By default, it will automatically use the repository who's executing the workflow.
```

## Tests

### Running Tests

To run tests simply execute the following in the directory containing `main.py`:

```python
python -m unittest discover
```

### Contributing Tests

These tests uses the [python's unit testing framework](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).

Since this project is contained all within one file, `main.py`. You can simply add a function to the `TestMain` class in `tests/test_main.py`, similar to the `test_graph` function.

## Extras

1. If you want to add the week in the Header of your stats, you can add `SHOW_TITLE: true` in your workflow file like this

    ```yml
    - uses: athul/waka-readme@master
            with:
              WAKATIME_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.WAKATIME_API_KEY }}
              GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
              SHOW_TITLE: true
    ```

    `SHOW_TITLE` flag can be set to true if you want to display the week number and days in the readme, by default it will be false. Here is an example output with `SHOW_TITLE` set to true.

    ```text
    Week: 11 July, 2020 - 17 July, 2020
    Python      8 hrs 52 mins       ███████████████████░░░░░░   75.87 %
    Go          1 hr 15 mins        ██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   10.79 %
    Markdown    52 mins             █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   07.43 %
    Docker      16 mins             ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   02.32 %
    YAML        7 mins              ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   01.07 %
    ```

2. You can specify a commit message to override the default _"Updated the Graph with new Metrics"_. Here is how you do it

    ```yml
    - uses: athul/waka-readme@master
            with:
              WAKATIME_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.WAKATIME_API_KEY }}
              GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
              COMMIT_MESSAGE: Updated the Readme
    ```

    If no commit message is specified in the `yml` file, it defaults to _"Updated the Graph with new Metrics"_

3. You can change the block characters to match with the style of your readme. By default the one show in the graphs before is used. Here is how you do it

    ```yml
    - uses: athul/waka-readme@master
            with:
              WAKATIME_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.WAKATIME_API_KEY }}
              BLOCKS: ⣀⣄⣤⣦⣶⣷⣿
    ```

    This will change the graphs to something like this:

    ```text
    Python      8 hrs 52 mins       ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀   75.87 %
    Go          1 hr 15 mins        ⣿⣿⣦⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀   10.79 %
    Markdown    52 mins             ⣿⣿⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀   07.43 %
    Docker      16 mins             ⣤⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀   02.32 %
    YAML        7 mins              ⣄⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀   01.07 %
    ```

4. As an alternative to official WakaTime, _waka-readme_ also integrates with WakaTime-compatible services like [Wakapi](https://wakapi.dev) and [Hakatime](https://github.com/mujx/hakatime). To use one of these, **adapt the API URL accordingly and use the respective service's API key** instead:

    ```yml
    - uses: athul/waka-readme@master
            with:
              WAKATIME_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.WAKATIME_API_KEY }}
              API_BASE_URL: https://wakapi.dev/api
    ```

5. If you don't like to share how much time you spent in each language, you can add `SHOW_TIME: false` in your workflow file like this

```yml
    - uses: athul/waka-readme@master
        with:
          WAKATIME_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.WAKATIME_API_KEY }}
          SHOW_TIME: false
```

`SHOW_TIME` flag can be set to false if you don't want to display the time spent in the readme, by default it will be true. Here is an example output with `SHOW_TIME` set to false.

```text
Week: 11 July, 2020 - 17 July, 2020
PHP          ████████████████████▒░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   49.98 %

Other        ██▒░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   05.87 %
```

## Why only the language stats and not other data from the API?

I am a fan of minimal designs and the profile readme is a great way to show off your skills and interests. The WakaTime API, gets us a **lot of data** about a person's **coding activity including the editors and Operating Systems you used and the projects you worked on**. Some of these projects maybe secretive and should not be shown out to the public. Using up more data via the Wakatime API will clutter the profile readme and hinder your chances on displaying what you provide **value to the community** like the pinned Repositories. I believe that **Coding Stats is nerdiest of all** since you can tell the community that you are _**exercising these languages or learning a new language**_, this will also show that you spend some amount of time to learn and exercise your development skills. That's what matters in the end :heart:
